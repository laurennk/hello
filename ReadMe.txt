Assignment 1 is composed of two classes, Compute and Calculator.
The Compute class is responsible for preforming operations and managing the program stack by pushing operands and results on to it and poping operands off of it.
The calculator class contains all of the IBAction functions that are associated with the buttons on the storyboard. These are divided into five seperate functions with one for digits(‘0’-‘9’ and ‘.’), operations(‘+’,’-‘,’/‘,’*’), negate(‘+/-‘), clear(‘C’), and equals(‘=‘). It also contains a function used for storing digits, by taking the display text and pushing it onto the stack, and an alert view that is called whenever the clear button is pressed.
